This will involve modifying the data preparation, model architecture, and evaluation steps to handle a sequence-to-sequence forecasting problem.\n","\n","**Dataset:** AEP Hourly Energy Consumption (available on Kaggle).\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Step 1: Data Loading and Exploration\n","\n","1.  **Download and Load:** Download the \"AEP_hourly.csv\" dataset. Load it into a pandas DataFrame.\n","2.  **Data Cleaning & Preparation:**\n","    * Sort the DataFrame by the index to ensure the time series is in chronological order.\n","3.  **Visualize:** Plot the entire time series to observe its trends, yearly seasonality, and weekly patterns. You may also want to plot a smaller slice (e.g., one month) to see the daily patterns more clearly.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Step 2: Preprocessing for Multi-Step Forecasting\n","\n","This is the most critical part of the assignment. The goal is to create sequences where the input (`X`) is a window of past hours and the output (`y`) is the subsequent 24 hours.\n","\n","1.  **Normalize the Data:** Just like in the lab, use `MinMaxScaler` to scale the `demand` column to a range between 0 and 1.\n","2.  **Modify `create_sequences`:** Rewrite the sequence creation function. It should now accept three arguments: the data, `n_past` (the number of hours to use as input), and `n_future` (the number of hours to predict).\n","    * **Logic:** The function should iterate through the data. For each iteration, it will grab `n_past` hours for the input and the *next* `n_future` hours for the output.\n","    * **Example:** If `n_past = 72` (3 days) and `n_future = 24` (1 day), the first sample would be:\n","        * `X[0]`: Data from hour 0 to 71.\n","        * `y[0]`: Data from hour 72 to 95.\n","3.  **Create the Data:** Use your new function to generate `X` and `y`. A good starting point is `n_past = 168` (1 week) and `n_future = 24`.\n","4.  **Reshape:** Reshape `X` to be `[samples, n_past, 1]` as required by the LSTM layer. `y` should have the shape `[samples, n_future]`.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Step 3: Build and Train the LSTM Model\n","\n","You need to modify the model so it can output a sequence of 24 values.\n","\n","1.  **Modify the Output Layer:** The simplest way to achieve this is to change the final `Dense` layer. Instead of having 1 unit, it should have `n_future` (e.g., 24) units.\n","    ```python\n","    # Example model architecture\n","    model = Sequential()\n","    model.add(LSTM(units=100, input_shape=(n_past, 1)))\n","    model.add(Dense(units=n_future)) # Output layer predicts 24 steps\n","    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')\n","    ```\n","2.  **Train the Model:** Split your data into training and testing sets (remember not to shuffle!) and train the model using the `.fit()` method as before.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Step 4: Evaluate and Visualize the Forecast\n","\n","1.  **Make Predictions:** Use `model.predict()` on your `X_test` data.\n","2.  **Inverse Transform:** Remember that your predictions and the actual test values (`y_test`) are scaled. Use `scaler.inverse_transform()` to return them to their original MW scale before calculating the error.\n","3.  **Calculate RMSE:** Calculate the Root Mean Squared Error between your predictions and the actual values.\n","4.  **Visualize Results:** The most important step! Create a plot that shows the actual vs. predicted values.\n","    * Pick a few example periods from your test set (e.g., 3 different 24-hour windows).\n","    * For each period, plot the `n_past` hours of actual data that the model used as input.\n","    * On the same plot, continue the line with the 24 hours of *actual* future data and overlay your model's 24-hour *prediction*. This will clearly show how well your model is forecasting.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Step 5: Optimize Your Model (Your Main Task)\n","\n","Your initial model will be a good baseline, but the goal is to improve it. Experiment with the following and document how each change affects your final RMSE and visualizations.\n","\n","* **Hyperparameters:**\n","    * Change the number of `units` in the LSTM layer (e.g., try 50, 100, 150).\n","    * Experiment with the `n_past` lookback window. Does using more or less history help?\n","    * Adjust the `batch_size` and number of `epochs` during training.\n","* **Architecture:**\n","    * **Stack more layers:** Add a second LSTM layer. Remember to set `return_sequences=True` on the first LSTM layer so it passes its full output sequence to the next one.\n","    * **Add Dropout:** Add `Dropout` layers after your LSTM layers to help prevent overfitting (e.g., `Dropout(0.2)`).\n"],"metadata":{"id":"2EKKEgZgabo-"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"lSOrlnAIaVkB"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}]}
