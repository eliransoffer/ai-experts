Unlike simple models that only use past prices, you will build a **multivariate** model that leverages multiple features for each time step, including technical indicators and overall market performance. This approach mimics a more realistic trading analysis.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Part 1: Data Collection and Feature Engineering\n","\n","Your first step is to gather and prepare the data. You will use the `yfinance` library in Python to download historical stock data.\n","\n","**1.  Data Acquisition:**\n","    * Choose a major technology stock, for example, **Apple Inc. (AAPL)**.\n","    * Download its daily data from **January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2023,** for the training set.\n","    * Download its data from **January 1, 2024, to the present** for the testing set.\n","    * Download the data for the **S&P 500 index (`^GSPC`)** for the same date ranges. This will serve as a feature representing the overall market condition.\n","    * Optionally, download another index or stock data\n","\n","**2.  Feature Engineering:**\n","    Create a single DataFrame for your stock and add the following features:\n","    * **Technical Indicators:** Calculate the following for your chosen stock:\n","        * A **20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA)** of the 'Close' price.\n","        * A **50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA)** of the 'Close' price.\n","        * The **14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI)**.\n","    * **Market Data:** Add the 'Close' price of the S&P 500 (`^GSPC`) as a feature for each corresponding day.\n","    * **Final Features:** Your model will use the following features to predict the next day's 'Close' price: `['Close', 'Volume', 'SMA_20', 'SMA_50', 'RSI', 'GSPC_Close']`.\n","    * Consider other features that can be added\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Part 2: Data Preprocessing and Model Building\n","\n","With your features ready, you need to prepare the data for the LSTM network.\n","\n","**1.  Scaling:**\n","    * Scale / normalize all your features. It's crucial to fit the scaler **only on the training data** and then use it to transform both the training and testing data.\n","\n","**2.  Sequence Creation:**\n","    * Write a function that converts your time-series data into supervised learning sequences.\n","    * Use a sequence length of **30 time steps**. This means your model will look at the features from the past 30 days (`X`) to predict the 'Close' price on the 31st day (`y`).\n","    * For each sequence, `X` should have a shape of `(30, 6)` (30 days, 6 features), and `y` will be the single 'Close' price to be predicted.\n","\n","**3.  Build the LSTM Model:**\n","    * Construct a neural network using Keras/TensorFlow. Example architecture:\n","        * An `LSTM` layer with 50 units.\n","        * A `Dropout` layer with a rate of 0.2 to prevent overfitting.\n","        * A second `LSTM` layer with 50 units.\n","        * A second `Dropout` layer with a rate of 0.2.\n","        * A `Dense` output layer with **1 unit** (for the single predicted price).\n","    * Compile the model using the `adam` optimizer and `mean_squared_error` as the loss function.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Part 3: Training, Evaluation, and Visualization\n","\n","Now you will train your model and evaluate its performance.\n","\n","**1.  Training:**\n","    * Train the model on your prepared training sequences for at least 25 epochs.\n","\n","**2.  Evaluation:**\n","    * Make predictions on the test set.\n","    * Remember that your predictions will be scaled. You must use the scaler's `inverse_transform` method to convert them back to their original dollar values.\n","    * Calculate the **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** between the actual prices and your model's predictions.\n","\n","**3.  Visualization:**\n","    * Create a plot that clearly shows:\n","        * The actual stock prices from the test set.\n","        * The predicted stock prices from your model.\n","    * Ensure your plot is properly labeled with a title, x-axis label ('Time'), and y-axis label ('Stock Price USD').\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Part 4: Change the task to classification task\n","\n","1. Now we want to provide good recommendation regarding the stock - BUY, SELL, HOLD.\n","2. In general, the thresholds are up to your decision, but you can think about something like:\n","    * if the closing price is 3% or more less then it was t days ago - BUY\n","    * if the closing price is 3% or more higher then it was t days ago - SELL\n","    * otherwise - HOLD\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","### ðŸŒŸ Bonus Challenge (Optional)\n","\n","* Experiment with different sequence lengths (e.g., 60 or 90 days) and report if it improved your RMSE.\n","* Add another technical indicator, such as the **MACD**, as a feature.\n","* Try changing model architecture."],"metadata":{"id":"FKsDMoTiAzOK"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"9zmG1UFYAqG0"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}]}
