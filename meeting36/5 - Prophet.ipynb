It determines the flexibility of the trend, and in particular how much the trend changes at the trend changepoints. If it is too small, the trend will be underfit and variance that should have been modeled with trend changes will instead end up being handled with the noise term. If it is too large, the trend will overfit and in the most extreme case you can end up with the trend capturing yearly seasonality. The **default of 0.05** works for many time series, but this could be tuned; a range of **[0.001, 0.5]** would likely be about right. Parameters like this (regularization penalties; this is effectively a lasso penalty) are often tuned on a log scale.\n","\n","**seasonality_prior_scale**: This parameter controls the **flexibility of the seasonality**. Similarly, a large value allows the seasonality to fit large fluctuations, a small value shrinks the magnitude of the seasonality. The **default is 10**, which applies basically no regularization. That is because we very rarely see overfitting here (there’s inherent regularization with the fact that it is being modeled with a truncated Fourier series, so it’s essentially low-pass filtered). A reasonable range for tuning it would probably be **[0.01, 10]**; when set to 0.01 you should find that the magnitude of seasonality is forced to be very small. This likely also makes sense on a log scale, since it is effectively an L2 penalty like in ridge regression.\n","\n","**holidays_prior_scale**: This controls flexibility to fit holiday effects. Similar to seasonality_prior_scale, it **defaults to 10** which applies basically no regularization, since we usually have multiple observations of holidays and can do a good job of estimating their effects. This could also be tuned on a range of **[0.01, 10]** as with seasonality_prior_scale.\n","\n","**seasonality_mode**: Options are **['additive', 'multiplicative']**. **Default is 'additive'**, but many business time series will have multiplicative seasonality. This is best identified just from looking at the time series and seeing if the magnitude of seasonal fluctuations grows with the magnitude of the time series (see the documentation here on multiplicative seasonality), but when that isn’t possible, it could be tuned."],"metadata":{"id":"Iz4oEmblASGZ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import itertools\n","\n","\n","param_grid = {\n","    'changepoint_prior_scale': [0.01, 0.1, 0.5],\n","    'seasonality_prior_scale': [0.01, 1.0, 10.0],\n","    'seasonality_mode': ['additive', 'multiplicative']\n","}\n","\n","# Generate all combinations of parameters\n","all_params = [dict(zip(param_grid.keys(), v)) for v in itertools.product(*param_grid.values())]\n","mapes = []  # Store the MAPEs for each params here\n","\n","# Use cross validation to evaluate all parameters\n","for params in all_params:\n","    m = Prophet(**params).fit(adf)  # Fit model with given params\n","    df_cv = cross_validation(\n","        m,\n","        initial=f\"{8*365} days\",  # Training period (8 years)\n","        period=f\"{3*30} days\",   # Spacing between cutoffs (3 months)\n","        horizon=f\"{2*365} days\",   # Forecast horizon (2 years)\n","        parallel=\"processes\"\n","    )\n","    df_p = performance_metrics(\n","        df_cv,\n","        rolling_window=1 # compute the metric across all simulated forecast points (not 10% as default)\n","    )\n","    mapes.append(df_p['mape'].values[0])\n","\n","# Find the best parameters\n","tuning_results = pd.DataFrame(all_params)\n","tuning_results['mape'] = mapes"],"metadata":{"id":"D2zTAZLAATLZ"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["tuning_results.sort_values('mape', ascending=True)"],"metadata":{"id":"bEs721D6zroC"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"-Vm1IhGX14Bq"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
