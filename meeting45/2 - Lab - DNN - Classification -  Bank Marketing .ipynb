Consider whether you want to split dataset to constant train + validation or use cross-validation.\n","4. Run short EDA on the data\n","5. Run simple preperocessing and cleaning on the data\n","6. Build DNN in iteration - start from simple DNN with 1 hidden layer and relatively small amount of neurons, and continue iterating by adding complexity no the DNN by adding more layers and / or neurons\n","7. Use strategies for reducing overfit if needed\n","8. Use BatchNormalization if needed\n","9. You might need to configure learning rate\n","10. Evaluate your training with tensorboard\n","11.
